This is a patch released as ver 1.0.1 for using GRCh38 in DeepMosaic. 

To use GRCh38 for DeepMosaic, scripts in this folder should be copied to overwrite the original scripts.

Note that most of the DeepMosaic performance data are evaluated in GRCh37decoy, the performance might differ if you are not using GRCh37decoy.
