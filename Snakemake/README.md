# Snakemake Wrapper for DeepMosaic

To facilitate the user to run DeepMosaic on high performance computing clusters at a large scale, we provide some snakemake wrappers for DeepMosaic.

First you should install [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 

After evaluation of the average number of input variants, you can choose to [split](https://github.com/Virginiaxu/DeepMosaic/tree/master/Snakemake/Split) or [run everything from a same sample in an individual job](https://github.com/Virginiaxu/DeepMosaic/tree/master/Snakemake/No_split).
