        Visualization and control-independent classification tool of mosaic SNVs with deep convolutional neural networks.
        
        * Information of aligned sequences for any SNV represented with an RGB image

        An RGB image was used to represent the pileup results for all the reads aligned to a single genomic position. Reads supporting different alleles were grouped, in the order of the reference allele, the first, second, and third alternative alleles, respectively. Red channel was used to represent the bases, green channel for the base qualitites, and blue channel for the strand orientations of the read.
        
        * DeepMosaic workflow: From variant to result (10 models were compared and Efficientnet b4 was selected as the best-performing):

        Workflow of DeepMosaic on best-performed deep convolutional neural network model after benchmarking. Variants were first transformed into images based on the alignment information. Deep convolution neural network then extract the high-dimontional information from the image, experimental, genomic, and population related information were further incoperated in to the classifier.

        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Step 0. Installation
        
        0.1. Install DeepMosaic
        
        ```
            git clone --recursive https://github.com/Virginiaxu/DeepMosaic
            
            cd DeepMosaic && pip install dist/DeepMosaic-0.0.tar.gz    
        ```
            
        0.2. Install dependency: bedtools (via conda)
        
        ```    
            conda install -c bioconda bedtools    
        ```
        
        0.3. Install dependency: ANNOVAR
        
           a) Go to the ANNOVAR website and click "[here](http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/download/)" to register and download the annovar distribution. 
            
           b) Once you have sucessfully download ANNOVAR package, run
            
        ```
            cd annovar && perl annotate_variation.pl -buildver hg19 -downdb -webfrom annovar gnomad_genome humandb/    
        ```
            
           to intall the hg19.gnomad_genome file needed for the feature extraction from the bam file
        
        
        ### Step 1. Image representation of Bam file based on input list of variants and feature extraction:
        
        ```
            deepmosaic-draw -i [input.txt] -o [output_dir] -a [path to annovar directory] 
        ```
        
        ### Step 2. Prediction for mosaicism
        
        ```
            deepmosaic-predict -i [output_dir/feature.txt] -o [output.txt]    
        ```
